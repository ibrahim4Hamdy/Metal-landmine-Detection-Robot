# Metal-landmine-Detection-Robot
This project involves the development of a wireless-controlled robot car designed for metal and landmine detection. The primary objective of this project is to create a remote-operated vehicle that can safely and effectively navigate through potentially hazardous areas to detect metals and landmines, minimizing the risk to human life.
